# Spam-Detection-using-Naive-Bayes-Classifier
This project implements a Naïve Bayes classifier to perform two-class classification for detecting spam emails. The model is trained on a labeled dataset containing examples of spam and non-spam (ham) messages. Using the probabilistic approach of Naïve Bayes, the classifier calculates the likelihood of each message belonging to either class based on the frequency of words and features extracted from the text. Despite its simplicity, the Naïve Bayes algorithm is highly effective for text classification tasks such as spam detection, due to its efficiency and ability to handle high-dimensional data. The project demonstrates data preprocessing, feature extraction using techniques like tokenization and vectorization, model training, and evaluation through metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. This solution provides a foundational understanding of applying machine learning to natural language processing problems, particularly in filtering unwanted emails and improving email security.
